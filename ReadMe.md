# Google Script - Uploader

Hello, this is a basic google script uploader that I coded for [Megathon'17](www.megathon.tech), it allows for direct uploads to a pre-specified drive and the code is pretty straight forward, do check it out.


## Features

**Security**
>The upload is verified by a captcha to nullify bots and crawlers.

**Customizability**
> The code is highly customisable to suit upload needs, one can specify upload size, format among other details.

**Classification**
> Different files can be named differently as per requirements, here, there were five categories, so each upload is saved with a prefix for the category it belongs to.
